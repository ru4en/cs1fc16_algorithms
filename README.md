## Introduction

For this report I am instructed to create 2 sets of algorithms. One of them will print out the nth number of the Fibonacci sequence using 2 different paradigms of programming. one recursively and the other imperatively. for the other algorithm I will be using the provided matrix library to extend it to compute matrix multiplications, additions, transpose, dot product and to get a column of the matrix from the provided column number. For these algorithms I will be using the C++ programming language.

## matrix library

As stated previously I will be extending the matrix library to support matrix multiplications, additions, transpose, dot product and get column. This will be implemented using 5 functions. 

Firstly, the matrix library comes with a matrix structure.

<<<<<<< HEAD
```C++
=======
``` c++
>>>>>>> a44ed6f3dbb647976dea0a05260c2f671120cb1f
struct myMat {			// allows for matrices up to size 4*4
	int numRows;		// number of rows
	int numCols;
	int data[256];		// data are stored in row order //** Had to switch from 4 to something over 200 for some reason.**//
};
```

As stated, the myMat struct will allow to create matrices up to 4 rows and 4 columns. The `numRows` variable and `numCols` variable stores the number of rows and columns to be created. The `data` variable holds the value of the matrix.

 To get the column of a matrix I will have to create a new matrix structure for the output. Then as shown below for every row we loop and append each element from the matrix to the output vector.

<<<<<<< HEAD
``` C++
=======
``` c++
>>>>>>> a44ed6f3dbb647976dea0a05260c2f671120cb1f
myMat mGetCol(myMat m, int col) {
	myMat res = zeroMat(m.numRows, 1); 				// create new matrix with 1 column
	for (int row = 0; row < m.numRows; row++)		// for each element in column
		res.data[row] = getElem(m, row, col);		// copy row element to res
	return res;
}
```

Next, I had to create a function to calculate the dot product of a given vector. This was simple as I had to loop over the columns and add the multiple of both the vectors to the result. This that can be outputted as an integer.

<<<<<<< HEAD
```C++
=======
``` c++
>>>>>>> a44ed6f3dbb647976dea0a05260c2f671120cb1f
int dotProd(myMat v1, myMat v2) {
	int prod = 0;									// initiate prod variable
	for (int I = 0; i < v1.numCols; i++){			// for each column in vector add prod plus the multiple of both the vectors
		prod = prod + getElem(v1,0,i) * getElem(v2,0,i);
	}
	return prod;
}
```

For `mTranspose` I created a matrix `mO` with the same number of rows and columns as the input matrix. Then using a loop each of the values of the matrix were flipped and copied to `mO`.

``` c++
myMat mTranspose(myMat m) {
	myMat mO = zeroMat(m.numCols, m.numRows);		// create a matrix mO with the same number of rows and columns as the input matrix.
	for(int i=0; i< m.numRows; ++i) {				// for each item in rom and for each column in row flip the values that reffer to  i and j.
		for(int j=0; j< m.numCols; ++j){
			int val = getElem(m, i, j);
			setElem(mO, j, i, val);
		}
	}
	return mO;
}
```

The matrix additionâ€™s function uses a loop that get the value `i` and `j` using the `getElem` function from both the matrices and add them together. the value of it is then set to the same location in the output matrix.

``` c++
myMat mAdd(myMat m1, myMat m2) {
	myMat m3 = zeroMat(m1.numRows, m2.numCols); 	// create a matrix with the same number of rows as the matrix1 and the same number of columns as the matrix2.
	for(int i = 0; i < m1.numRows; i++) {			//loop until all numbers in matrix1 and matrix1 are added to matrix3 and returned the matrix.
            for(int j = 0; j < m2.numCols; j++) {
				int val = getElem(m1, i, j) + getElem(m2, i, j);
                setElem(m3, i, j, val);
            }
        }
		return m3;
}
```
For the Matrix multiplication function, I created an object `m3` and if the rows and columns are equal to 1 the rows and columns are set to the number of rows and columns of the other matrix. if none of the matrices have 1 row or column the row on the new matrix is set to the number of rows as the first matrix and the column is sat to the number of columns as the second matrix.

Then for each row in the first matrix and the column in the second matrix get the value of i and j in the new matrix and it to the multiple of i and k from the first matrix and k and j from the second matrix. This is done until all the rows and columns have been processed.

``` c++
myMat mMult(myMat m1, myMat m2) {
	myMat m3;									// initiate matrix m3
	if (m1.numRows == 1 && m1.numCols == 1)		// if single row, column matrix inputted use the number of rows and columns as the other matrix.
	{
		m3 = zeroMat(m2.numRows, m2.numCols);
	}else if (m2.numRows == 1 && m2.numCols == 1) {
		m3 = zeroMat(m1.numRows, m1.numCols);

	}else {										// else set the number of rows the same size as the first matrix and column as the second matrix.
		m3 = zeroMat(m1.numRows, m2.numCols);
	}

	int val;									// variable to store values when loopes
	
	for(int i = 0; i < m1.numRows; ++i) { 		// loop trough A and B, multiply and to result, then return.
		for(int j = 0; j < m2.numCols; ++j) {
			for(int k = 0; k < m2.numRows; ++k) {
				int val = getElem(m3, i, j) + getElem(m1, i, k) * getElem(m2, k, j);
				setElem(m3, i, j, val);			// save the value of val to m3 and output when done
			}
		}
	}
	return m3;
}
```

The Following code try's to compute the questions set by Prof Richard Mitchell from his webpages accessible [here](https://www.personal.reading.ac.uk/~shsmchlr/jsmaths/AutumnAssignment.html). The Pictures after the code show the Output of set main function.

``` c++
int main()
{
	cout << "Richard's Matrix Example Program\n";

	cout << "Question 1. Matrix Calculation\n"; // Question 1 ----------------------------
	
	myMat Q1A = mFromStr("1,9,7;9,5,9"); 		// Matrix A
	printMat("A", Q1A);

	myMat Q1B = mFromStr("9,5,10;1,9,8"); 		// Matrix B
	printMat("B", Q1B);

	myMat Q1C = mFromStr("8,7;10,10;1,9"); 		// Matrix C
	printMat("C", Q1C);

	cout << "Calculate 1A + 10B\n";

	myMat Q1_1_mat = mFromStr("1");				// create 1x1 matrix of 1 (ik its unnecessary but its used to check if it works)
	myMat Q1_10_mat = mFromStr("10");			// create 1x1 matrix of 10
	myMat Q1_1A = mMult(Q1_1_mat, Q1A);			// Multiply 1 by Matrix A
	printMat("1A", Q1_1A);
	myMat Q1_10B = mMult(Q1_10_mat ,Q1B);		// Multiply 10 by Matrix B
	printMat("10B", Q1_10B);

	myMat Q1Ans1 = mAdd(Q1_1A, Q1_10B);			// Multiply 1A with Matrix 10B
	printMat("1A + 10B", Q1Ans1);				// print out the matrix


	cout << "Calculate 9A + 5C`\n";
	
	myMat Q1_9_mat = mFromStr("9");				// create 1x1 matrix of 9
	myMat Q1_5_mat = mFromStr("5");				// create 1x1 matrix of 5
	myMat Q1_9A = mMult(Q1_9_mat, Q1A);			// Multiply 9 by Matrix A
	myMat Q1_5C = mMult(Q1_5_mat, Q1C);			// Multiply 5 by Matrix C
	myMat Q1_5Ct = mTranspose(Q1_5C);			// get the transpose of the matrix 5C
	myMat Q1Ans2 = mAdd(Q1_9A, Q1_5Ct);			// Multiply 9A with Matrix 5C'
	printMat("9A + 5C`", Q1Ans2);				// print out the matrix
	
	cout << "Calculate C x B\n";

	myMat Q1Ans3 = mMult(Q1C, Q1B);				// Multiply Matrix C with Matrix B
	printMat("C x B", Q1Ans3);
	return 0;
```

## Fibonacci

Writing an algorithm to find and time Fibonacci sequences was the second task. Here I have 2 sets of styles that does the same task which is finding the nth Fibonacci number.

I have used the `chrono` library to get the execution time for each style of the Fibonacci sequences. 

To use this program `cd` into the `Fibonacci` directory and type `make`. To execute the program simply type `./main` .

```
Usage: 
        ./fib [-i/-r] [count] [-t] 

        -i      imperative
        -r      recursive
        -t      output time taken
```

### imperative version

In the imperative version a desired number is passed to the function and is looped that many times, each time adding the value of `fib1` and `fib2` to `fib`. Then moving `fib2` to `fib1`. The Value of `fib` is also moved to `fib2`. Finally the value of `fib2` is returned.

<<<<<<< HEAD
```c++
=======
``` c++
>>>>>>> a44ed6f3dbb647976dea0a05260c2f671120cb1f
int imp_fib(int count) { // function for Fibonacci Number using the imperative method
    std::cout << count << " Fibonacci Number using the imperative methord." << std::endl;

    for(int i = 2; i < count; i++){ 
        fib = fib1 + fib2;
        std::cout << fib2 << std::endl;
        fib1 = fib2;
        fib2 = fib;
    }
    return fib2;
}
```

### Recursive version
<<<<<<< HEAD

Using the recursive method, the function here does not use a loop yet is recursively called and the previous count is inputted as an argument. depending on if the value of `count` is 0, 0 is returned. if `count` is 1 then 1 is returned. else the function is called by passing the value of `count` and deducts the value by 1. the function is called again and `count` is passed as an argument this time deducts by 2. This method is usually slow as the values of previously calculated Fibonacci numbers are recalculated. hence the time complexity for it is exponential.

int rec_fib(int count) { // function for Fibonacci Number using the recursive method
    if (count == 0)
        return 0;
    if (count == 1)
        return 1;
    return rec_fib(count-1)+rec_fib(count-2);
}
```

## Reflection

In conclusion, coding these algorithms has made me more confident in C++ and programming in general. The Fibonacci sequence tasks also showed me the importance of optimization as getting a Fibonacci number in imperative can take significantly less time than recursive. I could have improved the readability of my code in future iterations. I think my code could also be improved in terms of optimization. matrix by a scalar, â€˜magicâ€™ matrix and Cramerâ€™s Rule matrix solving algorithms could also be implemented in the future.
